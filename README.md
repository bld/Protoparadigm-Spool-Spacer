Instructions
------------

Print two. Press fit 2 608 bearings into place. Secure with M3x15mm
bolts, nuts, and washers.

Put into spool. One will be inset.

Put 5/16" or M8 threaded rod through. Let threaded rod extend out far
enough to mount in your filament support system. Secure with nuts.

I wrapped the inset side with tape as a spacer before mounting in a
simple T made of 1x2s.
